# Recruit Genie

We have taken the scope provided for building LLM based application for HR process optimization

Our concept is a One-Touch Hire Application , where initially the Recruiter just gives the Job Description and Generative AI + Automation  does all the rest till the first-round evaluation and even selection !

The application is powered by two LLMs : Meta LLaMA and Open AI ChatGPT.

The Workflow is as follows:

1. Recruiter Logs into RecruitGenie and puts a Hiring Request
2. RecruitGenie enriches the Hiring Request Explanation and Post
3. Candidates can Search and Upload their Resume
4. RecruitGenie scans the candidate resumes and ranks them 
5. RecruitGenie frames the questions from the job description and emails a notice to candidates
6. RecruitGenie sends automated emails to top 30 ranked candidates
7. Candidates can respond to the questions online in interactive mode
8. RecruitGenie does automated evaluation and selection
9. RecruitGenie manages all the metrics and telemetry of the selection process and audits them

## Summary 
1. We have the fully functional application developed with Python, Flask, Open AI API, Meta LLaMA and other related libraries.
2. RecruitGenie completes the overall recruitment process of 1st Phase in less than 15 mins
3. RecruitGenie Works with any authentication provider
4. RecruitGenie is highly Performance and Scalable
5. RecruitGenie works on any cloud and can be hosted anywhere as LLMs API is provided by HuggingFace and Gradio Hosted models !
